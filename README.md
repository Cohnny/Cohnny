### 🌟 Pinned & Starred Projects I Like

#### 🧑‍💻 [User Management System](https://github.com/Cohnny/UserManagementSystem)
A Node.js CLI app with user registration, login, and password change features. Includes password rules (capital, number, special char, min 8 chars). Great for learning input validation and command-line interfaces.

#### 🔐 [Arduino Lock System](https://github.com/Cohnny/DigitalComboLock)
Digital lock system with keypad, EEPROM memory, LCD, and servo control. Fully standalone using Arduino hardware. Password persists across restarts thanks to EEPROM. Status feedback via LCD and LEDs. Super fun project bridging hardware and logic!

#### 🎲 [Lucky Number Game](https://github.com/Cohnny/LuckyNumber)
A Python game where players guess a lucky number from a dynamic list. Includes name and age validation. Implemented in both OOP and procedural style — great for comparing paradigms.

### 📚 Currently Learning
- Angular and Java (because of local job demand)
- MongoDB and WebSockets (for a shopping list app idea)
- CI/CD and test-driven workflows
